  <h2> Exploring an emerging programming language for large language models </h2>
</div>

The Language Model Query Language, or LMQL, is a programming language that was designed with the express purpose of language model interaction. LMQL was developed by the SRI Lab at ETH ZÃ¼rich and aims to make interactions between the user and language models smoother and more efficient. LMQL is unique in that it combines traditional programming with the ability to call large lanuage models (LLMs) in a user's code, allowing for the integration of LLM interaction natively at the level of program code.

This tutorial gives a more detailed overview of LMQL works, walks through how to get started with LMQL, explores its main features, and evaluates the efectiveness and efficiency of those features in comparison to those of an LLM used without LMQL. For follow-up questions about the tutorial or suggestions for improvement, please contact the author, [Amelia Opsahl](mailto:aopsahl25@cmc.edu).

## Understanding LMQL

An LMQL query is formatted very similary to a standard Python program. However, in an LMQL query top-level strings are interpreted as query strings that are passed to an LLM. For example:
```
@lmql.query
def example():
    '''lmql 
    "Q:How tall is the empire state building?"
    "A: [ANSWER]"
    return ANSWER
    '''
print(example())
```
Program Output: 
```
The Empire State Building is 1,454 feet (443.2 meters) tall.
```
This scenario shows how an LMQL query containing both traditional algorithmic logic and LLM calls can be used to automatically complete template variables like `ANSWER`. Moreover, LMQL queries can leverage natural language prompting to allow for more personalzied outputs to program variables and enhanced model reasoning capabilities. For example:
```
@lmql.query
def example1():
    '''lmql 
    "Q:How tall is the empire state building? Give me just the height in feet without any other informaiton."
    "A: [ANSWER]"
    return ANSWER
    '''
print(example())
```
Program Output: 
```
1,454 feet.
```
Here, we see how algorithmic logic, LLM behavior, and prompt engineering can all come together in LMQL programs to fine-tune program output and efficiently handle complex queries.

## Getting started - LMQL Installation

LMQL can be installed locally on a user's personal computer. This tutorial will walk through example LMQL queries that are run locally from within Python. 

> <span style="color:gray; opacity:0.7;">LMQL can also be used via a local instance of a playground IDE. Using the playground instance requires the installation of Node.js, which can be done by following the instructions on the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manage) website.</span>

To use LMQL in Python, users can import the `lmql` package, run query code with `lmql.run`, or use a decorator `@lmql.query` for LMQL query functions. This tutorial will use the `@lmql.query` decorator for Pyton integration. The `lmql.run` function is favorable in that it allows users to directly run a string of LMQL code without having to define a function, but this tutorial uses the decorator because of its included support for accessing the surrounding Python environment.

As seen earlier, the `@lmql.query` decorator uses a piece of LMQL code as a Python function, which can then be called from a user's existing code:
```
@lmql.query
def example2(): 
    '''lmql
    "Q: What is the sum of 2+5?"
    "A: [SUM]"
    return SUM
    '''
print(example2())
```
Program Output: 
```
7
```
In terms of query configuration, users can further control query execution by setting the model, decoder, logging parameters, etc. for the query. For example, the following code would override the model and decoder specified in the query program and communicate whether to print verbose logging outputs during execution (e.g., LLM inference parameters). 
```
@lmql.query(model = lmql.model("chatgpt"), decoder = "argmax", verbose=False)
def example3(): 
    '''lmql
    "Q: Name five bird species."
    "A: [SUM]"
    return SUM
    '''
print(example3())
```
Program Output:
```
1. Robin
2. Blue Jay
3. Bald Eagle
4. Hummingbird
5. Pigeon
```
## Feature 1 - Prompt Construction

LMQL uses expressive Python control flows (e.g., loops, conditions, and function calls) and string interpolation to facilitate dyanmic prompt construction and allow for increased structure in the model's output. 

EXAMPLE. 

LMQL also uses multi-part prompt programs to enable enhanced controls over the LLM reasoning process and improve the accuracy of the LLM's output.

For example: 
```
@lmql.query
def chain_of_thought(question): 
    '''lmql
    # Q&A prompt template
    "Q: {question}\n"
    "A: Let's find the answer by thinking step by step.\n\n"
    "[REASONED_ANSWER]"
    return REASONED_ANSWER
    '''
print(chain_of_thought("How many tennis balls fit in the Empire State Building?"))
```
The above code chunk defines an LMQL query template using the `@lmql.query` decorator. The program then takes a question as an input and outputs both the answer and the reasoning behind it. The model arrives at its answer using a step-by-step reasoning process as instructed in the internal prompt statement. 

An example output based on the above question would be something like this: 
```
First, we need to determine the volume of the Empire State Building. According to the building's official website, the volume is approximately 37 million cubic feet. 
Next, we need to determine the volume of a standard tennis ball. According to the International Tennis Federation, the volume of a tennis ball is approximately 2.5 cubic inches. 
Finally, we can calculate the number of tennis balls that can fit in the Empire State Building by dividing the volume of the building by the volume of a tennis ball. 
This gives us an estimated answer of 5.9 billion tennis balls. However, this is just an estimate as the actual number may vary depending on the size and shape of the tennis balls.
```
As we can see, the chain-of-thought prompting guides the LLM to think more logically about its answer and, thanks to this intentional process of reasoning, output a reasoned response based on existing data. 

There are many other ways to encourage an intentional reasoning process within the LMQL query. Users could modify the internal prompt statement to ask for an answer then ask for the reasoning behind it. Similarly, a user could prompt the model to explain why it arrived at its answer, which would also motivate the model to reevaluate its initial answer and its accuracy.  

# Evaluation 

idea - show how chain of thought makes the prompt more accurate, how other ways of illiciting reasoning do not work as well
