  <h2> Exploring an emerging programming language for large language models </h2>
</div>

The Language Model Query Language, or LMQL, is a programming language that was designed with the express purpose of language model interaction. LMQL was developed by the SRI Lab at ETH ZÃ¼rich and aims to make interactions between the user and language models smoother and more efficient. Indeed, it is unique in that it combines traditional programming with the ability to call large lanuage models (LLMs) in a user's code, allowing for the integration of LLM interaction natively at the level of program code.
