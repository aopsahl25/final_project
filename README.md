  <h2> Exploring an emerging programming language for large language models </h2>
</div>

The Language Model Query Language, or LMQL, is a programming language that was designed with the express purpose of language model interaction. LMQL was developed by the SRI Lab at ETH ZÃ¼rich and aims to make interactions between the user and language models smoother and more efficient. LMQL is unique in that it combines traditional programming with the ability to call large lanuage models (LLMs) in a user's code, allowing for the integration of LLM interaction natively at the level of program code.

This tutorial gives a more detailed overview of LMQL works, walks through how to get started with LMQL, explores its main features, and evaluates the efectiveness and efficiency of those features in comparison to those of an LLM used without LMQL. For follow-up questions about the tutorial or suggestions for improvement, please contact the author, [Amelia Opsahl](mailto:aopsahl25@cmc.edu).

## Understanding LMQL

An LMQL query is formatted very similary to a standard Python program. However, in an LMQL query top-level strings are interpreted as query strings that are passed to an LLM. For example:
```
@lmql.query
def example():
    '''lmql 
    "Q:How tall is the empire state building?"
    "A: [ANSWER]"
    return ANSWER
    '''
print(example())
```
Program Output: 
```
The Empire State Building is 1,454 feet (443.2 meters) tall.
```
This scenario shows how an LMQL query containing both traditional algorithmic logic and LLM calls can be used to automatically complete template variables like `ANSWER`. Moreover, LMQL queries can leverage natural language prompting to allow for more personalzied outputs to program variables and enhanced model reasoning capabilities. For example:
```
@lmql.query
def example():
    '''lmql 
    "Q:How tall is the empire state building? Give me just the height in feet without any other informaiton."
    "A: [ANSWER]"
    return ANSWER
    '''
print(example())
```
Program Output: 
```
1,454 feet.
```
Here, we see how algorithmic logic, LLM behavior, and prompt engineering can all come together in LMQL programs to fine-tune program output and efficiently handle complex queries.

## Getting started - LMQL installation

LMQL can be installed locally on a user's personal computer. This tutorial will walk through example LMQL queries that are run locally from within Python. 

> <span style="color:gray; opacity:0.7;">LMQL can also be used via a local instance of a playground IDE. Using the playground instance requires the installation of Node.js, which can be done by following the instructions on the [Node.js](website).</span>

To use LMQL in Python, users can import the `lmql` package, run query code with `lmql.run`, or use a decorator `@lmql.query` for LMQL query functions. This tutorial will use the `@lmql.query` decorator for Pyton integration.
