# In the following LMQL query function, the model is asked to calculate a complex mathematical word problem. 
# In its answer generation, the model is also instructed to use chain-of-thought reasoning to think
# step-by-step to solve the problem.
# The program output is the model's reasoning, which includes its final answer.
# The program also outputs what percent confident the model is in its answer.

# Expected Ouput: 
# REASONEDANSWER: First, we need to find out how long it will take for the second train to catch up to the first train. 
# Since the second train is traveling 20 miles per hour faster, it will take 1.5 hours for it to catch up 
# (240 miles / 20 miles per hour = 1.5 hours). 
# Next, we need to add 1.5 hours to the departure time of the second train (3:30 PM) to find out when the two trains will meet. 
# This gives us a meeting time of 5:00 PM. 
# Since the first train departed at 3:00 PM, it will have been traveling for 2 hours when the two trains meet. 
# Therefore, the two trains will meet at 5:00 PM, 2 hours after the first train departed.
# CONFIDENCE: 100% confident

# In the following LMQL query function, the model is asked to calculate a complex mathematical word problem. 
# The model is given no additional instruction on how to reason through its answer. 
# The program output is the model's answer, as well as what percent confident the model is in that answer.

# Example Output: 
# ANSWER: The two trains will meet when their combined distance traveled is equal to the distance 
# between the cities, which is 240 miles. 
# The first train will have traveled for 30 minutes before the second train departs, 
# so it will have covered 30 miles. 
# The second train will have to cover 240 miles - 30 miles = 210 miles to reach the meeting point. 
# The combined speed of the two trains is 60 miles per hour + 80 miles per hour = 140 miles per hour. 
# Therefore, it will take 210 miles / 140 miles per hour = 1.5 hours for the two trains to meet. 
# Since the second train departed at 3:30 PM, they will meet at 3:30 PM + 1.5 hours = 5:00 PM. 
# CONFIDENCE: I am 100% confident in my answer.
