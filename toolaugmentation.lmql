# The following LMQL query asks the model to output a math expression, with some specifications. 
# The program then generates the expression, 
# with the constraint to only include the information to the left of the equals sign.
# Finally, the program outputs the expression, 
# along with an answer to the expression, which is executed via Python's eval() function. 

# Example output: 
# MATH: 2 + 3
# eval(MATH): 5

# The following query asks the model to output a sentence with as many of one letter as possible,
# the letter in this case being x.
# After generating this sentence, 
# the program uses Python's count function to count all the xs that appear in the generated sentence.
# Finally, the program outputs the sentence, as well as the count for how often x appeared.

# Example output:
# SENTENCE: The xylophone player expertly executed a complex melody, 
# showcasing their exceptional dexterity and musicality.
# COUNT: 6

# providing insight into the diversity of life in the ocean.
